# Standard controls included in react native

Wondering about the standard controls included in react native?

Me too!

So, this project has no redux, no navigation, no logic, no brains, no taste, no juice... just typing all the different controls on a view and see what it looks like.

## How to run this code?

```sh
# Cloning the repo to 'standardcontrols'
git clone git@github.com:rodrigoelp/reactnative-typescript-exercise-9.git standardcontrols
# Changing directory
cd standardcontrols
# Installing dependencies
yarn # if you have not installed yarn, then change it to: npm install
# Compiling the typescript code
./node_modules/.bin/tsc
# Launching the react-native development server
open -a Terminal "`react-native start`"
# Compiling the code for ios and deploying it to the simulator
react-native run-ios # optionally, type: react-native run-android
# Alternatively, you could comment the line above and run the two lines below.
# open -a Terminal "`react-native run-ios`"
# open -a Terminal "`react-native run-android`"
```
